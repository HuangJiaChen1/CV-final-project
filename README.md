# CV-final-project

# Code Execution Guide:
Ensure you have installed tensorflow in your environment

Run preprocess.py -> training.py -> track_DL.py for the DL tracker

For contrasting purposes, run track_LK -> visualization.py to see
the comparison of the two trackers.

Note that the DL tracker is not always better than the traditional Lukas-Kanade tracker.

The preprocessed data used to train the model is too big to upload, please train the model on your own, the dataset is integrated in the code.
